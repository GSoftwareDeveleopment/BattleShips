# BattleShips
BattleShip game

## Idea
The project started under the inspiration of a friend.
The intention of this project is to present the construction of the game using OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

## Basic Assumptions

  1. Using a JavaScript to write game
  2. Use object oriented programming (OOP)
  3. Allow two people to play
  ### NOTE
  https://service.a-bolt.pl/BattleShips/ <- Here is a working version of the game where you can play with another person.

  4. Give the opportunity to play with the computer
  
  I am currently working on implementing a computer for the game, and in the future I want to use AI
