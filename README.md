# BattleShips
BattleShip game

The project started under the inspiration of a friend.
The intention of this project is to present the construction of the game using OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

# NOTE
https://service.a-bolt.pl/BattleShips/ <- Here is a working version of the game where you can play with another person.



I am currently working on implementing a computer for the game, and in the future I want to use AI
